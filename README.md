# Graph Traversal Algorithms in C#

A C# implementation of fundamental graph traversal algorithms with adjacency list representation.
##  Features
- **Undirected Graph Implementation** using adjacency list
- **Depth-First Search (DFS)** - Recursive implementation
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** - Iterative implementation
- **Vertex Tracking** with `HashSet<int>`
- **Bidirectional Edges** automatically created
